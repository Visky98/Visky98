ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, \
	my name is Andrea and I am an italian physicist. \
	I'm an IT enthusiast, a musician and an aviation lover.\
	Now I work as a Junior ETL developer.\
	I used programming languages such as C, C++, Python and Matlab doing Data Analysis at the University and in the last year I learned SQL and Informatica PowerCenter at work.\
	Hope to grow more and more studying and deepening my knowledge and skills.
