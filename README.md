ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, \
	my name is Andrea and I am an italian physicist. \
	I'm an IT enthusiast, a musician and an aviation lover.\
	Currently I'm working as a Junior ETL developer, developing DWH and KPI for BI.\
	 I dealt with the basics of C, C++, and Phyton for data analysis and in the last year I learned SQL, PL-SQL and Informatica PowerCenter.\
	Hope to grow more and more studying and deepening my knowledge and skills.
